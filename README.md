# IXmapsClient

IXmapsClient is open source software (based on node.js) that generates traceroute data used to determine the paths packets take to different sites. IXmapsClient sets up a web server that only answers queries from your host, then opens a browser page to access the interface. IXmapsClient runs on port 2040. It can be installed and executed from a built release on the [Contribute page of the IXmaps web site](https://www.ixmaps.ca/contribute.php) or by [downloading and setting up the development version](https://github.com/ixmaps/IXmapsClient/). Either way, we welcome your comments and participation.

## Downloading and running IXmapsClient

### Running on Linux

Download the prepackaged version. Unpack it, go to the shell and run the command `sudo ./node server.js`. The IXmapsClient interface should appear in your browser, or use your browser to go to http://localhost:2040/.

### Running on MacOS X

### Running on Windows

## Developing IXmapsClient

Since IXmapsClient is an open source project, anyone can download its sources, inspect them, and make pull requests which can be integrated into the main project for fixes and improvements.

### Install and build packages

This version of TRgen is based on node.js. For installation, https://github.com/creationix/nvm seems to work well. Once installed, use `nvm install node 4.2`

You will also need appropriate build tools for your OS installed (eg build-essentials, or on Mac OS, the basic XCode).

Then:

`$ npm install -g gulp && npm install && gulp build && npm run-script webpack-production`

### Executing

#### Run the server

Since you're accessing raw sockets, you must run as root (eg sudo). Make sure your root user has node available.

`# npm start`

This should also launch your web browser pointing to the local TRgen interface. If the interface can't be opened, you can manually go to http://localhost:2040

IXmapsClient can also be run as a public service, which should be used with caution. `npm run-script public`.

### Packaging

#### Command line execution

`# node trace-raw`

use -h for help.
